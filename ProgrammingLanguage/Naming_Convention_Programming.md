# Naming convention (programming)
In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.

Reasons for using a naming convention (as opposed to allowing programmers to choose any character sequence) include the following:[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming))

To reduce the effort needed to read and understand source code;
To enable code reviews to focus on issues more important than syntax and naming standards.
To enable code quality review tools to focus their reporting mainly on significant issues other than syntax and style preferences.

Programmers employ numerous tactics to ensure readable and organized code. These include:

* Using naming conventions for variables;
* Placing whitespaces, indentations and tabs within code;
* Adding comments throughout to aid in interpretation.
